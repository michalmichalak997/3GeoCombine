Abstract
This study proposes a multi-stage methodology for estimating the orientation of fault planes that influence the geometry of geological contacts. In this methodology, the information about the estimated orientation is assumed to be ultimately used in spatial clustering, i.e., distilling homogenous patterns from data sampled throughout a faulted contact. Orientation data were obtained through applying triangulation on a network of boreholes, and two synthetic models of contacts having approximately two dozen points and a similar number of triangles were created. Based on these models, we demonstrated a substantial limitation of the proposed method for calculating the expected orientation. The discussed limitation follows from the following reason. While triangulated models often decrease the fault dip angle, investigating the variability in dip direction is of greater importance because it is crucial for conducting spatial clustering. To constrain the variability of the triangles’ dip direction, we employed a combinatorial algorithm to get all possible planes from the given point set, which helped achieve greater concentration of observations around the expected dip direction, and produced additionally counterintuitive orientations of the triangles. The discussed singularities were assumed to be geometrical in nature and therefore require special attention. For conducting spatial clustering within faulted contacts, we suggest considering a wider interval of orientations related to faults. This is because these orientations can be genetically related with faults even if they indicate a relatively high directional within-dissimilarity. Statistical methods for circular data were suggested for assessing the confidence intervals.
